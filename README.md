**Lab:** 1 - HTTP File Server with TCP Sockets  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  

## Project Overview

This laboratory assignment presents a comprehensive implementation of a HTTP/1.1 compliant file server utilizing low-level TCP socket programming in Python 3.11. The system architecture demonstrates fundamental network programming principles while providing practical web server functionality comparable to production-grade solutions. The implementation encompasses multiple file type serving capabilities (HTML, PNG, PDF), dynamic directory browsing with modern web interface design, and includes a companion HTTP client application for testing and validation purposes.

### Academic Learning Outcomes Achieved

The implementation of this HTTP file server has provided valuable hands-on experience with several key computer networking concepts:

**1. Socket Programming Mastery**  
The direct use of Python's socket library without high-level HTTP frameworks demonstrates a deep understanding of network communication at the transport layer. The server successfully manages TCP connections, handles concurrent requests sequentially, and maintains proper connection lifecycle management.

**2. HTTP Protocol Implementation**  
The project exhibits accurate implementation of HTTP/1.1 protocol standards, including proper request parsing, response header generation, status code handling, and MIME type detection. The server correctly processes GET requests and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found).

**3. System Design and Architecture**  
The modular design separates concerns effectively with distinct functions for request handling, response generation, directory listing, and file serving. The implementation follows software engineering best practices with proper error handling and security considerations.

### Technical Contributions and Innovation

Several aspects of this implementation demonstrate technical excellence beyond basic requirements:
